# Sales Analysis Using Python

Welcome to my project on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), a fundamental aspect of data science. EDA is a crucial step, often consuming a significant portion of a data scientist's time, and is essential for uncovering insights. In this project, I have showcased various EDA methods and techniques using Python, applied to the Diwali Sales dataset from Kaggle.
Explore the methods and insights, and enjoy your journey into EDA with the Diwali Sales dataset. 
Good luck!
